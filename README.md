  ## Description

  This project prompts the user to add employees of a team to a template along with any relevant information. It then takes that information and writes an HTML file.

  ## Installation

  Install Node.js by following this link (Mac) “https://www.webucator.com/how-to/how-install-nodejs-on-mac.cfm” Then run “npm install” in your terminal 

  ## Usage

  Once everything is installed, simply type “node app.js” in the terminal. The user will then be confronted with a series of prompts where they type out information for a manager and any number of interns and engineers. After all the prompts are completed, it will write the file into the same folder.
